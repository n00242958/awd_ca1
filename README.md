# AWD CA1 'Laravel Movies'

This is an implementation of the CRUD pattern in Laravel based on a
film rentals model. It contains a complete Model-View-Controller setup
as well as an authentication system provided by Laravel.

I have also added the ability to search movies by title or description
keywords through implementing the Laravel Scout package.
